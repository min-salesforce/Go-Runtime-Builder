## Feature Set Guide

[Back to Configuration Plan](configuration_plan.md)

### What is a Feature Set?

Feature Sets are a grouping mechanism in Salesforce Go that represent a goal or task for the user. These jobs are described with straightforward language and focus on the value for the user. A Feature Set must include at least two features.

Use a Feature Set when:
- There is more than one Feature you need to group
- There is a JTBD (Job to be Done) that the group of Features solve for

If you only have a single customer-facing capability to add to an existing Feature Set, consider defining a Feature instead. See the Feature guidance in the Configuration Plan.

### Define your Feature Set

1. Define the job your user is going to accomplish (JTBD). This becomes the title of your Feature Set.
2. List all of the Features that would help a user accomplish that job. A bulleted list works well because you can see your information architecture start to form.
3. Reach out to your content designer to co-design your information architecture. If you need support and don’t have a content design partner, reach out to the Go team via our support options.
